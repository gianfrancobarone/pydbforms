#PyDBforms

####What is PyDbforms? 
PyDbforms is a db forms  generator for sqlite. Basically the idea behind is to create a python library to  make GUI CRUD operations just telling to python the name of the table e the sqlite file. This is due I'm have a lot of small projects to do with db capability. Ok that's enough for now. More to come!

####Current development 
Currently working in read the data form sqlite (columns names and types etc.) and create a grid with the data.

####Usage 
Sqlite:
You must define a sqlite table with at least a Primary key with autoincrement and you are done.

Python:
In main file you must define the sqlite db file and the table(s) name.
